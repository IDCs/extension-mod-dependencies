      <p>Setting rules between conflicting mods will decide which mod's files "win" the conflict by loading after the other conflicting files.</p>
      <p>You can think of it like the "winning" mod overriding the other mod, only that you can always come back and flip the rule without having to reinstall your mods.</p>
      <p>When it comes to deciding which mod should go after the other, there are a few things to consider.</p>
      <p>It is strongly advised to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Load patches and options after their base mod</li>
        <li>Load mods depending on others after their dependency</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following is generally advised, but may not always produce the desired results:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Load newer mods after older ones. ("Use Suggestions" is based on this principle)</li>
        <li>Load lesser known mods after very popular ones</li>
        <li>Load the mods you care most about after the ones you can live without</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
